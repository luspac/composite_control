/**
 * :package: **botbuilder-dialogs**
 * 
 * A `DialogContainer` makes it easy to take an existing set of dialogs and package them up as a 
 * control that can be used within another bot. The control can be used either as a dialog added
 * to the other bots `DialogSet` or on its own for bots that are using some other conversation
 * management system.
 * 
 * ### Control Packaging
 * 
 * You'll typically want to package your control as a new class derived from `DialogContainer`.
 * Within your controls constructor you'll pass the `DialogSet` containing your controls dialogs
 * and the `ID` of the initial dialog that should be started anytime a caller calls the dialog.  
 * 
 * If your control needs to be configured then you can pass through the configuration settings as 
 * a set of `defaultOptions` which will be merged with any options passed in by the caller when 
 * they call `begin()`. These will then be passed as arguments to the initial dialog that gets 
 * started.
 * 
 * Here's a fairly simple example of a `ProfileDialog` that's designed to prompt the user to 
 * enter their name and phone number which it will return as a JSON object to the caller:
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { DialogContainer, TextPrompt } = require('botbuilder-dialogs');
 * 
 * class ProfileDialog extends DialogContainer {
 *     constructor() {
 *         super('fillProfile');
 *         
 *         this.dialogs.add('fillProfile', [
 *             async function (dc, options) {
 *                 dc.instance.state = {};
 *                 await dc.prompt('textPrompt', `What's your name?`);
 *             },
 *             async function (dc, name) {
 *                 dc.instance.state.name = name;
 *                 await dc.prompt('textPrompt', `What's your phone number?`);
 *             },
 *             async function (dc, phone) {
 *                 dc.instance.state.phone = phone;
 * 
 *                 // Return completed profile
 *                 await dc.end(dc.instance.state); 
 *            }
 *        ]);
 * 
 *        this.dialogs.add('textPrompt', new TextPrompt());
 *     }
 * }
 * module.exports.ProfileDialog = ProfileDialog;
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Consume as Dialog
 * 
 * On the consumption side the control we created can be used by a bot in much the same way they 
 * would use any other prompt. They can add a new instance of the control as a named dialog to  
 * their bots `DialogSet` and then start it using a call to `DialogContext.begin()`.  If the 
 * control accepts options these can be passed in to the `begin()` call as well.
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { DialogSet } = require('botbuilder-dialogs');
 * const { ProfileDialog } = require('./profileControl');
 * 
 * const dialogs = new DialogSet();
 * 
 * dialogs.add('getProfile', new ProfileDialog());
 * 
 * dialogs.add('firstrun', [
 *      async function (dc) {
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Welcome! We need to ask a few questions to get started.`);
 *          await dc.begin('getProfile');
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, profile) {
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Thanks ${profile.name}!`);
 *          await dc.end();
 *      }
 * ]);
 * ```
 * 
 * ### Consume as Control
 * 
 * If the consuming bot isn't dialog based they can still use your control. They will just need 
 * start the control from somewhere within their bots logic by calling the controls `begin()` 
 * method:
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 * const state = {};
 * const control = new ProfileDialog();
 * await prompt.begin(context, state);
 * ```
 * 
 * The control will populate the `state` object passed in with information it needs to process
 * the users response. This should be saved off with the bots conversation state as it needs to be
 * passed into the controls `continue()` method on the next turn of conversation with the user:
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 * const control = new ProfileDialog();
 * const result = await control.continue(context, state);
 * if (!result.active) {
 *     const profile = result.result;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * The `continue()` method returns a `DialogResult` object which can be used to determine when 
 * the control is finished and then to access any results it might have returned. To interrupt or 
 * cancel the control simply delete the `state` object the bot has been persisting.
 * @param R (Optional) type of result that's expected to be returned by the control.
 * @param O (Optional) options that can be passed into the begin() method.
 * @param C (Optional) type of `TurnContext` being passed to dialogs in the set.
 */
export class DialogContainer<R = any, O = {}, C extends TurnContext = TurnContext> extends Dialog<C> {
    /** The controls dialog set. */
    protected dialogs: DialogSet<C>;

    /**
     * Creates a new `DialogContainer` instance.
     * @param dialogId ID of the root dialog that should be started anytime the control is started.
     * @param dialogs (Optional) set of existing dialogs the control should use. If omitted an empty set will be created.
