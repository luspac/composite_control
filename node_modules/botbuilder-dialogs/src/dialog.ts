 * Base class for all dialogs.
 * 
 * The `Control` and `CompositeControl` classes are very similar in that they both add `begin()` 
 * and `continue()` methods which simplify consuming the control from a non-dialog based bot. The
 * primary difference between the two classes is that the `CompositeControl` class is designed to
 * bridge one `DialogSet` to another where the `Control` class assumes that the derived dialog can 
 * be used in complete isolation without the need for any other supporting dialogs.  
 * @param C The type of `TurnContext` being passed around. This simply lets the typing information for any context extensions flow through to dialogs and waterfall steps.
 * @param R (Optional) type of result that's expected to be returned by the control.
 * @param O (Optional) options that can be passed into the [begin()](#begin) method.

     * the control is still active before continuing.
     * 
     * **Usage Example:**
     *
     * ```JavaScript

     * @param options (Optional) additional options supported by the control.

 * Dialog optimized for prompting a user with a series of questions. Waterfalls accept a stack of
 * functions which will be executed in sequence. Each waterfall step can ask a question of the user
 * and the users response will be passed as an argument to the next waterfall step.
 * 
 * For simple text questions you can send the user a message and then process their answer in the 
 * next step:
 * 
 * ```JS
 *  dialogs.add('namePrompt', [
 *      async function (dc) {
 *          dc.instance.state = { first: '', last: '', full: '' };
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`What's your first name?`);
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, firstName) {
 *          dc.instance.state.first = firstName;
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Great ${firstName}! What's your last name?`);
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, lastName) {
 *          const name = dc.instance.state;
 *          name.last = lastName;
 *          name.full = name.first + ' ' + name.last;
 *          await dc.end(name);
 *      }
 *  ]);
 * ```
 * 
 * For more complex sequences you can call other dialogs from within a step and the result returned 
 * by the dialog will be passed to the next step:
 * 
 * ```JS
 *  dialogs.add('survey', [
 *      async function (dc) {
 *          dc.instance.state = { name: undefined, languages: '', years: 0 };
 *          await dc.begin('namePrompt');
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, name) {
 *          dc.instance.state.name = name;
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Ok ${name.full}... What programming languages do you know?`);
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, languages) {
 *          dc.instance.state.languages = languages;
 *          await dc.prompt('yearsPrompt', `Great. So how many years have you been programming?`);
 *      },
 *      async function (dc, years) {
 *          dc.instance.state.years = years;
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Thank you for taking our survey.`);
 *          await dc.end(dc.instance.state);
 *      }
 *  ]);
 * 
 *  dialogs.add('yearsPrompt', new NumberPrompt(async (dc, value) => {
 *      if (value === undefined || value < 0 || value > 110) {
 *          await dc.context.sendActivity(`Enter a number from 0 to 110.`); 
 *      } else {
 *          return value;
 *      }
 *  }));
 * ```
 * 
 * The example builds on the previous `namePrompt` sample and shows how you can call another dialog
 * which will ask its own sequence of questions. The dialogs library provides a built-in set of 
 * prompt classes which can be used to recognize things like dates and numbers in the users response.
 * 
 * You should generally call `dc.end()` or `dc.replace()` from your last waterfall step but if you fail 
 * to do that the dialog will be automatically ended for you on the users next reply.  The users 
 * response will be passed to the calling dialogs next waterfall step if there is one.
